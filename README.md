# Support-Vector-Machine
Implementation of Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine tries to find a line/hyperplane (in multidimensional space) that separates two classes.
Pros of SVM

It works really well with a clear margin of separation.
It is effective in high-dimensional spaces.
It is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
It uses a subset of the training set in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.
